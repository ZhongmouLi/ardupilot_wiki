The timeline for `GSoC 2026 is here <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline>`__

How to improve your chances of being accepted
=============================================

When making the difficult decision about which students to accept, we look for:

- Clear and detailed application explaining how you think the project could be done
- Relevant prior experience
- Experience contributing to ArduPilot or other open source projects
- Understanding of Git and/or GitHub

Fleet Management WebTool
------------------------

- Skills required: Javascript, Python
- Mentors: Ryan Friedman, Randy Mackay
- Expected Size: 175h
- Level of Difficulty: Medium
- Expected Outcome: Webtool to ease the management of a fleet of ArduPilot vehicles

The goal of this project is create a fleet management web tool that helps companies and individuals manage the data collected by multiple ArduPilot vehicles

- Should extend the capabilities of the existing `LogFinder Webtool <https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/WebTools/LogFinder/>`__
- Accept onboard logs, tlogs, photos and videos uploaded by the GCS or from the vehicle's companion computer (possibly running BlueOS or APSync)
- Allow users to search and download data based on vehicle ID, recording date, location
- Support both table views and map views of the uploaded data

Funding will be provided for hardware and cloud server as required.
